✅ What is CRR (Cross-Region Replication)?
CRR automatically replicates objects from one S3 bucket (source) in one region to another bucket (destination) in a different region.

🧠 Use Case: Disaster recovery, lower latency, compliance, etc.

🛠️ STEP-BY-STEP: Set Up Cross-Region Replication
📍 Step 1: Create the Source Bucket
Go to S3 → Create bucket

Bucket name: source-bucket-crr-<your-unique-id>

Region: e.g., US East (N. Virginia)

Uncheck Block all public access (only if needed)

Enable Versioning

Click Create bucket

📍 Step 2: Create the Destination Bucket
Create another bucket:

Name: destination-bucket-crr-<your-unique-id>

Choose a different region, e.g., Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

Enable Versioning

Click Create bucket

📍 Step 3: Create an IAM Role for Replication
Go to IAM → Roles → Create role

Choose S3 as the service

Use S3 -> S3 replication use case

Attach the default replication policy

Name the role: s3-crr-role

Click Create Role

📍 Step 4: Enable Replication on the Source Bucket
Go to Source bucket → Management tab

Click Create replication rule

Name: replicate-to-destination

Status: Enabled

Choose entire bucket

Destination:

Bucket: Choose the destination bucket from the list

Change the region to match the destination bucket

IAM Role: Choose s3-crr-role

Additional options:

Replicate existing objects (optional)

Choose whether to replicate delete markers (optional)

Click Save

✅ Test CRR
Upload a file to the source bucket

Wait a few moments

Check the destination bucket in the other region — the object will appear there automatically
